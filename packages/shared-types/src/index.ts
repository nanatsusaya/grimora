/**
 * @grimora/shared-types — foundational types shared across the whole monorepo.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free and framework-agnostic on purpose: this package is imported by the
 * rule-agnostic core, the plugin SDK, the offline sync layer, and every app. The architecture
 * harness (`shared-types-is-a-leaf`, ADR 0003 §3) enforces that it imports no other workspace
 * package, so domain/adapter/plugin vocabulary can never creep into this leaf.
 *
 * What belongs here: only *truly generic* concepts (the Shared Kernel, ADR 0003 §9) — ids, the
 * event-sourcing envelope infrastructure (ADR 0004 §2), and the `Result` type. Rule-system or
 * domain vocabulary lives in `core-domain`; the plugin contract lives in `plugin-sdk`.

 * identifiers (`sessionId`, `deviceId`) are **pseudonymous personal data** — **not** "non-personal"
 * (ADR 0004 §2 amendment 2026-07-09, ADR 0023 §3): opaque, stable pseudonyms re-identifiable only via
 * the relational account store and erased by destroying that mapping — never a person's name/email, and
 * never behavioural analytics (that is ADR 0019, consent-gated). It is generic event-sourcing
 * infrastructure — not domain or plugin vocabulary — which is why it is allowed in this leaf package
