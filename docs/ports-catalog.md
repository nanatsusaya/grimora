# Ports catalog

A single, current reference of every port in the hexagon (ADR 0003 §1/§7). ADR 0003 §7 introduced this
table as a **stub** ("expanded by ADRs 0004–0010") — this doc is that expansion, kept up to date as
Phase 2 actually builds adapters against it. It is **not** a decision record: every port's contract is
owned by the ADR(s) in the "Owning ADR(s)" column; this doc only indexes and tracks implementation
status. If a port's contract changes, the ADR changes (by amendment or superseding ADR) and this table
is updated to match — never the other way round.

**Where ports live in code:** every port is a TypeScript interface in
[`packages/core-domain/src/application/ports.ts`](../packages/core-domain/src/application/ports.ts)
(Domain/Application depend only on these, never on concrete adapters — ADR 0003 §1 dependency rule).
Adapters (SQLite, Postgres, Supabase Auth, pino, …) live outside the hexagon and are wired at a
composition root (`apps/*`). The walking skeleton (#61) implements every port used so far as an
**in-memory fake** (`packages/core-domain/src/testing/fakes.ts`, ADR 0017 R1) — real adapters are a
Phase-2 deliverable, not a Phase-1 one.

## Status legend

- **Real (in-process)** — the port's implementation *is* the core logic (no external I/O to swap), so
  there is nothing further to build beyond the existing code.
- **Skeleton fake** — an in-memory, deterministic stand-in exists (`testing/fakes.ts`) and is exercised
  by tests/the walking skeleton; no adapter with real I/O exists yet.
- **Not yet implemented** — declared only in an ADR; no interface, fake, or adapter exists in code yet.

## Catalog

| Port | Purpose | Owning ADR(s) | Status now | Planned adapter(s) (local / cloud) | Phase-2 driver |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EventStorePort` | Append-only per-aggregate event log, optimistic concurrency via `expectedVersion` | ADR 0004 §4, ADR 0005 §1 | **Real (native + browser OPFS)** — `@grimora/event-store` `createSqliteEventStore` (`bun:sqlite`, durable, `UNIQUE(aggregate_id, version)`), held to the shared `eventStoreContract`; **web driver Real** — `@grimora/event-store/opfs` (SQLite-WASM over OPFS SAHPool), hosted in a Web Worker at the `apps/web` composition root and **browser-verified** by the #105-C Playwright smoke (persists across reload); in-memory fake still used for pure tests. | SQLite native ✅ / OPFS (web) ✅; Postgres (Supabase) cloud via sync → #107 | #103 ✅ (native); #105-B ✅ (OPFS driver) + #105-C ✅ (browser-wired) |
| `ReadModelStorePort` | Denormalized, checkpointed read models the UI queries — never the event store | ADR 0004 §5, ADR 0005 §1 | **Real (native + browser OPFS)** — `@grimora/cqrs-read` `createSqliteReadModelStore` (`bun:sqlite`, durable, rebuild-from-0 via `clear()`), held to the shared `readModelStoreContract`; the `characterSheet` projection runs over it + the real event store end-to-end; **web driver Real** — `@grimora/cqrs-read/opfs`, worker-hosted alongside the event store at the `apps/web` composition root (#105-C); in-memory fake still used for pure tests. | SQLite native ✅ / OPFS (web) ✅; cloud projections via sync → #107 | #104 ✅ (native); #105-B ✅ (OPFS driver) + #105-C ✅ (browser-wired) |
| `ClockPort` | Injected time — Domain never reads the wall clock directly | ADR 0004 §9 | **Real** — system clock wired at the `apps/web` composition root (#105-C); `createFixedClock` still used in tests | System clock (prod) ✅ / fixed instant (tests) | #105-C ✅ (wired at the first real composition root) |
| `IdGeneratorPort` | Injected id generation — deterministic in tests | ADR 0004 §2 | **Real** — production **UUIDv7** generator (`apps/web` `id-generator.ts`, RFC 9562, time-ordered, unit-tested), wired at the composition root (#105-C); `createSequentialIdGenerator` still used in tests | UUIDv7 (prod) ✅ / sequential-prefixed (tests) | #105-C ✅ (wired at the first real composition root) |
| `PolicyPort` (+ `AuthorizationPort`, ADR 0009 §3) | Pure `(actor, action, resource) → boolean` authorization decision, enforced per use case | ADR 0009 §3, ADR 0010 §2 | **Real (in-process)** — `createRoleMatrixPolicy` (`application/policy.ts`, #106), wired at the `apps/web` composition root; full `Role` vocabulary (owner/gm/player/spectator) is part of the port surface and unit-tested, but only the `owner` branch is reachable in production until a membership read model exists (#107/#120) — `createOwnerPolicy` stays as the test-only skeleton fake (ADR 0022 §7, ADR 0017 R1) | GM/Player/Spectator resource-scoped resolution once campaign membership exists | #107/#120 (membership resolution) — #106 itself is done |
| `AuthPort` | Authentication: sign-in, session, session-change subscription (token issuance/refresh/storage is the adapter/composition-root concern, ADR 0012 §5) | ADR 0009 §3, ADR 0012 §5/§13 | **Interface + fake (E1); server-side proxy real (E2)** — the `AuthPort` interface + `createInMemoryAuthPort` exist (#120 E1); the **`apps/api` auth proxy** against Supabase GoTrue (`/api/v1/auth/*`: sign-in/refresh/sign-out, HttpOnly refresh cookie per ADR 0012 §5) is built + unit-tested behind a `SupabaseAuthClient` interface and live-smoke-verified against real Supabase (#120 E2). The **client-side** `AuthPort` adapter (`apps/web` `createHttpAuthPort` → the proxy, access token in memory + `restore()` from the refresh cookie, ADR 0012 §5) is built + unit-tested against a fake `fetch` (#120 E3a). The login **UI** (`AuthPanel`) + composition wiring is done and the whole flow (login → reload-restore → sign-out) is **browser-verified end-to-end** against live `apps/api`+Supabase (gated e2e, #120 E3b). The **ADR 0012 §13 first-bind** (record device → account binding on first login, "Reading 2": keep the stable local principal, apply the mapping at sync push) is built + unit- and browser-tested (#120 E4). | Supabase Auth via the `apps/api` auth proxy (web, ADR 0012 §5) / self-hosted GoTrue (ADR 0009 §3) | #120 — E1–E4 ✅ (auth binding complete); consent-capture hook (ADR 0015 §9) deferred to #73; sync attribution consumes the binding in PR C (#107) |
| `SecretsPort` | Secret injection at the composition root only | ADR 0010 §4 | Not yet implemented | env / vault, composition-root only | Whichever ticket first wires a real secret (Supabase keys, AI provider keys) — likely the `apps/web`/`apps/api` composition root work |
| `CryptoPort` | Encryption primitives for per-subject DEKs / crypto-shredding | ADR 0005, ADR 0010, ADR 0023 | Not yet implemented | WebCrypto (web) / libsodium (native) | #92 landed the classification/redaction surface *without* crypto (by design — `plugin-sdk/privacy.ts`); the first real caller is now the crypto-shredding / DSAR-erasure work (#74) |
| `AiProviderPort` | AI *proposes* a tool call; the agent loop executes it through the same use case + authz as the UI | ADR 0008 §1 | Skeleton fake (`createScriptedAiProvider`) | Ollama (no-consent default) / Claude / OpenAI (opt-in, ADR 0008/0015) | Not in this vertical slice — deferred until an AI chat surface is built |
| `RuleSystemRegistryPort` | In-process rule-system/plugin registry (loaded definitions, provenance) | ADR 0006 §5, ADR 0020, ADR 0021, ADR 0025 | **Real** (`createPluginHost`, `application/plugin-host.ts`) — in-process logic, no external I/O to swap | `plugins/dsa5` (first-party) | Already real; extended as new plugins/rule systems are added |
| `SyncPort` | Insert-only replication + domain rebase against the cloud | ADR 0005 §3/§4, ADR 0011 §7, ADR 0024 | **Skeleton fake** — the `SyncPort` interface (`push`/`pull` per ADR 0005 §3) now exists in `ports.ts` with an in-memory fake (`createInMemorySyncPort`, modelling cloud ingestion) held to a shared `syncPortContract` (#107 PR A); the test-only `sync-harness.ts` still validates the rebase logic directly. No real adapter yet. | Custom sync engine over Supabase Postgres (`apps/api` + `packages/offline-sync`) | #107 — PR A (contract) ✅; rebase orchestration + cloud adapter next |
| `ObjectStoragePort` | Binary asset storage | ADR 0005 | Not yet implemented | MinIO (local) / Cloudflare R2 (cloud) | Trigger-gated (asset pipeline, Epic #52) — not in this slice |
| `PluginHostPort` | In-process plugin loader (load/register) | ADR 0006 | **Real** — folded into `createPluginHost` (`application/plugin-host.ts`), same implementation backing `RuleSystemRegistryPort` | n/a (in-process) | Already real |
| `LoggerPort` | Structured logging, PII-redacted at the adapter | ADR 0009 §2 | Not yet implemented | pino (backend) / Sentry (frontend) | Whichever composition root lands first (likely `apps/web` shell or the event-store adapter) |
| `ConsentPort` | Event-sourced, versioned, resource-scoped consent record | ADR 0015 §2 | Not yet implemented | — (in-core, event-sourced) | #73 (already ticketed, currently blocked) |
| `RealtimePort` | Liveness-only "new events for stream X" signal — never a second data path into the UI | ADR 0024 §6 | Not yet implemented | Supabase Realtime | After the sync adapter exists; not required for this slice's exit criteria |

## Notes

- **`AuthorizationPort` vs. `PolicyPort`:** ADR 0009 §3 and ADR 0003 §7 name both; the skeleton's single
  `PolicyPort` interface (`ports.ts`) already covers the authorization-decision contract both refer to —
  there is no separate `AuthorizationPort` type in code, and none is planned; treat the two ADR names as
  synonyms for one port.
- **Ports with no adapter gap:** `ClockPort`/`IdGeneratorPort` are trivial to make "real" (a thin
  system-clock/UUIDv7 wrapper) and are not tracked as their own tickets — they get wired in as a side
  effect of the first real composition root, not as standalone work.
- **Keep this table in sync** with `packages/core-domain/src/application/ports.ts` whenever a port is
  added, renamed, or gains a real adapter — a stale ports catalog is worse than none (CLAUDE.md: stale
  documentation is a defect).
